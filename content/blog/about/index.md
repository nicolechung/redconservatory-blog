##Common questions people ask me

###Where are you from?
I was born in East York, Toronto, and I grew up in Highland Creek, Scarborough.

###But I mean, where is your family from?
Guyana.

###No, but really, where were your parents born?
Really. Guyana.

###No, I mean, your grandparents?
I'm serious now. Guyana.

###Is Guyana in Tibet?
No, it’s in South America. But it’s culturally part of the Caribbean.

###Do you speak Chinese?
No. Many Chinese Caribbean people are looked down upon by Chinese people, this is often because we are children of Second Wives.

I personally suspect that even though the Caribbean is very Christian, monogamy is not the norm. But don't tell my mother this.

###Lei ho ma?
OMG. Please.

###What is your gender?
For some reason my bank used to send me mail as “Mr. Nicole Chung”. Most people identify me as non-binary. I have no preference although I generally identify as a woman.

###How did you learn to code?
I went to school for Image Arts (Film and Video) at Ryerson, then did a course on web stuff at Centennial College where I learned HTML.

However, at the time I graduated, the market crashed so I went back to working as a production assistant/grip in the film world in Toronto. To clarify, I wasn't really working on the most glamourous stuff - music videos, some commericals, and the occasional daily on union sets.

Otherwise I am self-taught, which is code for “Stack Overflow”, “breaking stuff”, and years of freelancing. After that I started working at Nascent, where I probably learned the most to date.
